# Mind Guess ðŸŽ¯

An interactive Java console game where the computer guesses the number youâ€™re thinking of â€” any integer, positive or negative â€” using binary search.

## Versions

* **One-Sided Expansion** â†’ Starts at `0`, doubles outward (`0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4 â†’ â€¦`) until your number is bracketed, then binary search finds it.
* **Symmetric Expansion** â†’ Expands both directions (`[-1,1] â†’ [-2,2] â†’ [-4,4] â€¦`) until your number is bracketed, then binary search finds it. Faster for negative numbers.

## How to Run

Compile and run either version:

```bash
javac MindGuess.java
java MindGuess
```

## Example: One-Sided Expansion

```
Welcome to Mind Guess!
Think of ANY integer (positive or negative).
Is your number 0? (higher/lower/correct)
higher
Is your number 1? (higher/lower/correct)
higher
Is your number 2? (higher/lower/correct)
higher
Is your number 4? (higher/lower/correct)
lower
Is your number 3? (higher/lower/correct)
correct
Yay! I guessed your number: 3
```

## Example: Symmetric Expansion

```
Welcome to Mind Guess!
Think of ANY integer (positive or negative).
Is your number between -1 and 1? (yes/no/correct-if-boundary)
no
Is your number between -2 and 2? (yes/no/correct-if-boundary)
no
Is your number between -4 and 4? (yes/no/correct-if-boundary)
yes
Is your number 0? (higher/lower/correct)
higher
Is your number 2? (higher/lower/correct)
lower
Is your number 1? (higher/lower/correct)
